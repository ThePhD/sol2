The guidelines for reporting a bug are relatively simple and are as follows:

1. Produce a simple, short, compilable test case that reproduces your problem.
2. Make a descriptive title that summarises the bug as a whole.
3. Explain the bug in as much detail as you can in the body of the issue. 
4. Include Compiler/IDE, Build and Deployment System, Language (C++, Objective-C++).

If you want to request a feature:

2. Produce any relevant imaginary code that illustrates what you would like or desired behavior.
1. Include a description and title of what you would like.
3. Annotate and describe the behavior through comments, asserts or just a small write up.
